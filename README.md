Problem
There is a sensor that is read with the function:
	float readsesor();
Create a function that reads the sensor and checks if the reading
is above a given threshold. If so it shall save all readings to a 
file but in such a way that the file will contain a +-10 sample 
margin before and after the triggering of the threshold.
Use C/C++ or Python

Input Data
Float numbers generated by  readsesor()
Output Data
File 
Data Format
Text file 
Problem to resolve
Create a function that reads the sensor 
checking if the reading is above a given threshold. 
If it is true → all readings to a file 
the file will contain a +-10 samples before and after every trigger 
→ for a given number of samples to process
Model
Sensor
Buffer
Technologies used
C++ and STL
Assumptions
assumption filename: samples.txt
to test the classes →readsensor() → a random float in a range
number of samples to process
